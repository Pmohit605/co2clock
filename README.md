# co2clock.info

Simple website that shows a clock counting down the time till the worldwide CO2 budget as suggested by the IPCC is depleted. 
This website was inspired by the [carbon clock](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/research/co2-budget.html) of MCC-Berlin.  

It also shows a list of countries and their percentage share of the global CO2 emissions.  

A jupyter notebook with data preprocessing using python is included.
SPYDER is used that gives more flexibility and better GUI

Machine learning will help in real time processing of various problems
